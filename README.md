# 2D and 3D Cape Demo Project
Demo project for Godot 4.3 showcasing a 2D physics cape in 3D.

# Disclaimer
Repo is currently unfinished! Will complete soon.
The script to create the cape is a @tool, but there a few issues with it. If you change any variables for 
the cape within the editor you are bound it get some errors. After adjusting the variables just close and re-open
the Demo or Cape scene to see your changes.

# Info
The Cape is a 2D object that is added as a child of a SubViewport in a 3D scene. The cape itself has 
a couple variables to adjust the cape, including the amount of points, cape size and rendering.
Although this is showcasing how to do this in 3D, it is perfectly capable to apply this in 2D project.
